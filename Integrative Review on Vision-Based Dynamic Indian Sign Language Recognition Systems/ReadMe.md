### Abstract
Human-computer interaction is capable of solving
the complex problems and challenges faced by human beings,
among many of the complex jobs Sign Language Recognition is
one of them. Therefore, automatically detecting the sign
language is a broad area of research many works have been
done in this area, and still, the work is going on. A variety of sign
languages can be found throughout the globe sometimes the sign
languages can be diversified by the country or region, the sign
language(SL) which is available in India is known as the Indian
Sign Language(ISL). Indian sign language requires the
involvement of both hands, face, and upper body part movement
which makes it difficult from the other single-handed sign
languages. If we compare the Static gesture identification with
the dynamic gesture identification, it’s obvious that the former
is easier. In real-life scenarios, a system should have the ability
to identify the continuous and dynamic gestures, so that it can
become an interface between the hearing impaired people and
the normal people. Therefore, an Integrative review has been
presented here which strongly summarizes the works on Indian
Sign Language Recognition(ISLR) systems capable of
identifying the dynamic and continuous Vision-based gestures
without using any gloves or sensor-enabled wearables.
